## 📖 About the project
The project is built for the OBA in Amsterdam, they want to have a way to let users search on topic and have related books/articles/lessons with that.
The data comes from the given OBA API, the API gives a lot of data and has a lot of possibilities for searching and different kind of queries, downside is that the API is almost always overloaded on 'Live Server' in VSCODE, if deployed to Github the API can make easy call and gets a good response.
